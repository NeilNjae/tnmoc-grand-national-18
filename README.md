# tnmoc-grand-national-18

The [TNMOC]() "[Grand National](http://www.tnmoc.org/news/news-releases/grand-digital-won-nine-year-old)" was held on 18 February 2018 and pitted a variety of historic computers against each other. The challenge was to calculate as many terms in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in 15 seconds. 

Alternative implementations of the TNMOC "Grand National"

The results on the day were:

| Machine | Year | Terms | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|-------|
| Facit calculator | 1940s | 7 | Manual mechanical calculator |
| Dekatron Witch | 1951 | 4 |  |
| PDP-8 | 1965 | 16 | |
| Apple ][ | 1977 | 38 |  |
| BBC Micro | 1981 | 70 |  |
| Windows 98 PC | 1998 | 1477 | Calculation in Excel spreadsheet |
| Apple iPhone 6S | 2015 | 4 | Used Siri voice assistant |
| MicroBit | 2017 | 6843 |  |

The implementations here are to show what a standard PC can do. On my PC, (an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz, lots of RAM, running [Ubuntu 17.10](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/1710)), I got these results:

| Program  | Terms |
|--------- |-------|
| Python 3 | 1,174,787 |
| Haskell (GHC 8.0.2) | 77,045,721 |
